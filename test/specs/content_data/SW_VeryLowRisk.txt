Surface water Very low risk More information about your level of flood risk from surface water This flood risk summary reports the highest risk from surface water within a 15 metre radius of this property. Very low risk means that this area has a chance of flooding of less than 0.1% each year. This information is suitable for identifying: which parts of counties or towns are at risk, or have the most risk the approximate extent and depth of flooding It's unlikely to be reliable for a local area and very unlikely to be reliable for identifying individual properties at risk. Surface water flooding happens when rainwater cannot drain away through the normal drainage systems. Instead, it lies on or flows over the ground. Surface water flooding is sometimes known as flash flooding. It can: be difficult to predict as it depends on rainfall volume and location happen up hills and away from rivers and other bodies of water affect areas with harder surfaces, like concrete, more severely Lead local flood authorities (LLFA) are responsible for managing the flood risk from surface water and may hold more detailed information. Your LLFA is council. View a map of the risk of flooding from surface water
