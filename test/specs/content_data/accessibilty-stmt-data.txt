Technical information about this website's accessibility
The Environment Agency is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.
Compliance status
This website is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2 AA standard, due to the following exemptions.
Non-accessible content
The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.
Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations
There are several instances of non-compliance with WCAG level AA. These are:
navigation landmarks do not provide a label that is descriptive enough to inform a user of their function, which does not meet the requirement for WCAG 2.4.6 Headings and labels
the Friendly Captcha grey information text does not meet the requirement for WCAG 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)
the map focus element does not meet the requirement for WCAG 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast
the colours used in the flood depth graphic, for both the grey against the white background and the grey against the blue produce a contrast ratio, which does not meet the requirement for WCAG 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast
zoom controls are removed from various map pages when viewed in WCAG reflow settings at 1280 x 1024px at a magnification of 400%. Additionally, the positioning of certain elements over the map does not account for the addition of a scroll bar and some of the text is cropped. This does not meet the requirement for WCAG 1.4.10 Reflow
We will to fix these issues in the following ways:
we plan to add a descriptive aria-label attribute to the navigation landmark that allows a screen reader to know this section is for page navigation
we will make sure text colours used provide sufficient contrast against the background, so that the outlines of the text characters are sufficiently defined for low vision users
we plan to use the format indicated in the GOV.UK Design System, for understanding focus state styles
we will make sure the flood depth graphics achieves a colour contrast ratio of least 3:1 against any adjacent colours
we plan to make sure the map pages can be viewed as a single column at 320px without any loss of content or functionality
We will look to address these issues by December 2025.
Content that's not within the scope of the accessibility regulations
The website has the following content which is out of scope of the accessibility regulations:
maps
third party content which is out of our control, for example a corporate logo on the map the website uses
PDF content that was published before 23 September 2018
What we’re doing to improve accessibility
we have fixed 7 issues that failed to meet the WCAG version 2.2 A standard
we are working to fix all other content which fails to meet the WCAG version 2.2 AA standard and we will update this page when these issues are fixed
once we have fixed these issues, we will conduct usability testing with people with accessibility needs
