Technical information about this website's accessibility
The Environment Agency is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.
Compliance status
This website is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard, due to the following exemptions.
Non-accessible content
The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.
Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations
There are a number of elements of the map user interface that are not fully descriptive or accessible. These are:
The colour contrast of the scale icon used on the Ordnance Survey mapping fails to meet the required contrast ratio (WCAG 1.4.3 Contrast - Level AA) in certain situations.
The colour contrast used in various elements of the mapping fails to meet the required contrast ratio (WCAG 1.4.3 Contrast - Level AA) in certain situations.
The zoom controls provided on the maps do not provide a label that is descriptive enough to inform a user of their function (WCAG 2.4.6 Headings and labels - Level AA).
We are looking to fix these issues in the following ways:
We are exploring ways to improve the accessibility of the controls on the map user interface so that they are more descriptive and usable before December 2022.
We are planning an investigation of a more accessible scheme to differentiate layers used in mapping across all flood services. We plan to carry out this work before July 2023.
We are planning an investigation about offering alternative, more accessible versions of the Ordnance Survey mapping layers before July 2023.
