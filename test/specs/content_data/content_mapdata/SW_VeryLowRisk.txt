be difficult to predict as it depends on rainfall volume and location
happen up hills and away from rivers and other bodies of water
affect areas with harder surfaces, like concrete, more severely
Lead local flood authorities (LLFA) are responsible for managing the flood risk from surface water and may hold more detailed information.
Your LLFA is Warrington council.
