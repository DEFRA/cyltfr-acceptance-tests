Very low risk means that this area has a chance of flooding of less than 0.1% each year.

This information is suitable for identifying:

which parts of counties or towns are at risk, or have the most risk
the approximate extent and depth of flooding
It's unlikely to be reliable for a local area and very unlikely to be reliable for identifying individual properties at risk.
