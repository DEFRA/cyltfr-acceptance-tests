This information tells you the flood risk of the land around a building, not the building itself.
Flooding is hard to predict and there is always a chance any flood water could be deeper than what we show.

At this location there's a Medium chance of flooding to 20cm (or 8 inches).
Between 2040 and 2060 this stays at a Medium chance of flooding to 20cm (or 8 inches).
At 20cm, flood water can get into some homes and buildings, especially if the property has a basement. At this level, water can also damage your car or cause a breakdown.

At 60cm, we expect flood water to get into homes and buildings. Water at this level can float most vehicles, including 4x4s.
Flood protection measures are usually effective up to 60cm. You should not try and keep flood water out of buildings if it's over 90cm. Water at this level can cause collapse or permanent structural damage.
